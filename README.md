# Driver_Drowsiness_Detection
Driver drowsiness detection is a project built using Dlib and OpenCV with Python as a backend language.

# Logic of project
The project involves direct interaction with both the Dlib library's face detector and the 68 facial landmark detector. The 68 facial landmark detector is an effective and robustly trained detector that identifies the locations on the face that indicate whether or not the eyes are open.
